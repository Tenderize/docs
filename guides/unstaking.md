# Unstaking
Instead of instantly swapping to underlying tokens and incurring a swap fee, you can chose to unstake your tokens, wait for the unstaking period and then withdraw your underlying tokens. 

### Unstake
You can do this by hitting the unstake button on the "Stake" tab. You are then presented with a modal to enter the amount you want to unstake. Note that this step is irreversible, and once you unstake the only way to retrieve your tokens is to wait for the unstaking period and withdraw.

### Withdraw
You can check the status and time left for your unlocks to process by clicking on the "Withdraw" button. Once they are processed the withdraw button will become active, and you can simply click it and sign the transaction to receive your tokens.

#### Note on unstaking periods
Each protocol has a different unstaking period as indicated in the app. Some protocols like the Graph and Matic do not support simultaneous unstakes from the Tenderizer, because of which unstakes are batched and sent to the underlying protocol. This leads to an increase in the unstaking period, double the duration in the worst case scenario.
